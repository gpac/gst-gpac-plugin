## Commits

In this repository we try to follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary) for commit messages. This is a convention that makes it easier to understand the changes made in a commit by looking at the commit message. [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) action uses this convention to determine the next version number and generate a changelog.
